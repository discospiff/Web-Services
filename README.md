Web services examples

1. Have a stated position. Enjoy! Emails with only a link or picture and no position taken will be ignored.
2. Ad hominem attacks will be ignored. 
3. Auto-responders are considered BadFaith to a healthy debate. Having an auto-responder on will have your threads ignored.  
4. One word logical fallacies must be accompanied with justification.   So if you say "strawman", explain why it is a strawman; how it misinterpreted your position.  A concise, one line justification is fine.   
5. A majority of the debaters has the authority to decide if a post is germane to the subject or not. Other posters may invoke a ruling on subsequent posts to determine if they are germane or not. Subject germaness will be determined by majority.
